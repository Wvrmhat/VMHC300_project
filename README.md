## Abstract

In this research, we investigated how a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) can support doctors and nurses, especially in cancer wards. The system would assist them in assessing patient symptoms and offers treatment suggestions and diagnostic alerts. By notifying doctors when patients show signs of cancer, the system aims to improve patient care, reduce errors in diagnosis, and speed up the process of identifying the disease. Feedback was given on the CDSS while conducting interviews and this is reflected upon during evaluation where the limitations encountered are also addressed. The concerns of using the CDSS are discussed in detail under how it would impact nursing management. The report concludes the effectiveness of the system and how it would improve and support the delivery of quality care within the oncology ward.
